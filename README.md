# 🎮 Ransomware Simulation with Game Distraction

This project was created for the **Information Security** course as part of a university assignment.

## 🧠 Concept

The ransomware simulation is designed to showcase how attackers might use **social engineering + distraction** to trick users:

1. 🎮 **User plays a small game** (like Snake or something harmless).
2. 🔐 While distracted, the ransomware **simulates file encryption**.
3. 💰 Once the game ends, a ransom note appears asking for payment (e.g., via BTC and Telegram contact).
4. 🔓 After "payment", the tool **decrypt** the files.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Game is launched first.
- After a game ends, the simulation displays an encryption warning.
- data encryption is triggered.
- A ransom screen appears demanding money to decrypt.

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is created **strictly for educational purposes**. It demonstrates how ransomware typically works.
